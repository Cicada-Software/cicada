# The `title` Statement

The `title` statement can be used to give a name for your workflow.

Use the following syntax to add a title to your workflow:

```
title Your title here!
```

Similar to function calls, you can include expressions in your title, and
they will be reflected in the title:

```
let name = "Testing"

title Running (name) Workflow
```
