# Running Cicada on GitHub Codespaces

Thank you for taking the time to look into Cicada! You're almost ready to get started, but first
you'll need to run the setup script:

`$ ./cicada/setup.sh`

A new browser tab will automatically open when the server is finished starting.

> If a tab doesn't open click on the "Ports" tab next to the "Terminal" tab,
> then click the URL under "Local Address".

There should be a big green button. This button will create a custom GitHub App that integrates with
your self-hosted instance of Cicada. Click it, accept the permissions, and you'll be redirected back
to Cicada.

That's it! Just restart the webserver and refresh the page, and your self-hosted Cicada instance will
be ready to go!
